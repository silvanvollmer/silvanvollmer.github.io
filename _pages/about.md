I am a PhD student at the [Copenhagen Causality Lab](https://cocala.github.io/) of the [University of Copenhagen](https://www.math.ku.dk/english/research/spt/cocala/) under the supervision of [Niklas Pfister](https://niklaspfister.github.io/) and [Sebastian Weichwald](https://sweichwald.de/). My research focuses on identifying and estimating causal effects in real-world data problems. A key challenge arises when confounding is unobserved, and only a proxy variable for the confounder is available. How severe is the measurement bias introduced by adjusting for the proxy instead of the confounder? Under which assumptions is the causal effect identifiable? These are fundamental questions I explore during my PhD. If this topic interests you, do not hesitate to reach out to me!
