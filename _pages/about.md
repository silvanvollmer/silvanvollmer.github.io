I am a PhD student at the [Copenhagen Causality Lab](https://cocala.github.io/) of the [University of Copenhagen](https://www.math.ku.dk/english/research/spt/cocala/) under the supervision of [Niklas Pfister](https://niklaspfister.github.io/) and [Sebastian Weichwald](https://sweichwald.de/). My interest lies in refining methods for estimating causal effects within the context of real-world data problems.
